# VideoAnalysis
Example of how Hugging Face can be used to summarize videos and perform sentiment analysis.


The internet is full of videos about peopleâ€™s experiences and opinions on the products they use. Currently, most of these videos have not been analyzed as they required a manual human review. However, AI has the potential to automate review of these videos. Currently, there is not a single AI model that can accomplish this. However, by using multiple different AI models in a data pipeline you can accomplish this. New tools like Hugging Face make it easy to build and maintain these advance data pipelines. These tools are also agnostic and can be run in the cloud or on your local machine. In this poster I explore how videos can be analyzed using multiple pre-trained AI models.


Will be filled in with the analysis soon!
